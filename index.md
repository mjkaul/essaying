Welcome. 

Essays have existed, in some form or another, across languages and cultures, for pretty much as long as humans have written. The word is from French—to *essay* is to attempt, to try. Essays are pursuits. What is pursued? Understanding—of oneself and the world.

The French essayist Michel de Montaigne—the first to use the term *essay*—lived a rich life of adventure and public service. (For a good overview of his life, read Stefan Zweig's wonderful little book on Montaigne, published by Pushkin Press. You could also read Sarah Bakewell's longer biography of Montaigne, *How to Live*, which is wonderful in many ways, though the author's anti-religious prejudice gives her, in my opinion, certain blind spots when it comes to understanding Montaigne.) 

Part of the delight in a good essay comes from being drawn into another mind, and thereby expandign your view of the world through the addition of one more perspective on it. In this respect, essays are utterly unlike artificial intelligence, which always remains inscrutable. Another part of the delight comes from seeing an essayist develop over time. Montaigne constantly revised his own essays, editing, expanding, and transforming them as he himself exapdned and transformed. The essays here will function similarly: this won't be a blog in the sense of a constant stream of new thoughts—the world is flooded by such streams—but rather a more-or-less consistent set of essays on the themes that are most important to me; this set will be in a continuous process of revision over time, and thanks to GitHub, where the essays are hosted, you'll be able to see how my thoughts change over time. 

Thanks for visiting. I hope you enjoy these *essays*, and I hope they inspire you to some essaying of your own.
